•	Method Length: Keep methods concise. If a method exceeds 30 lines, consider refactoring.
•	Code Duplication: Eliminate duplicate code through abstraction or utility methods.
•	Magic Numbers and Strings: Replace them with named constants or enums for clarity.
•	Choose the most appropriate data structures for the task (e.g., ArrayList vs. LinkedList, HashMap vs. TreeMap).
•	Be mindful of the performance implications of different implementations.
•	Be vigilant about potential deadlocks; document and adhere to lock acquisition ordering.
•	Use atomic variables and concurrent data structures where necessary.
•	Throw exceptions that are specific and informative.
•	Do not suppress exceptions; handle them appropriately or rethrow them with added context.
•	Use structured logging with appropriate log levels.
•	Avoid logging sensitive information.
•	Ensure that log messages are clear, concise, and provide necessary context.
•	Implement proper authentication and authorization checks.
•	Use of Page Object Model (POM): -
	•	Organize page elements and actions within dedicated page classes.
	•	Avoid locating elements directly within test methods.
	•	Synchronization:
	•	Use explicit waits (WebDriverWait) instead of implicit waits or Thread.sleep().
	•	Ensure that tests are robust against varying page load times.
	•	TestNG Annotations:
	•	Use appropriate TestNG annotations (@BeforeClass, @AfterMethod, etc.) for test setup and teardown.
	•	Group tests logically using TestNG groups.
	•	Exception Handling:
	•	Handle exceptions specific to Selenium (e.g., NoSuchElementException) appropriately.
	•	Avoid empty catch blocks; log exceptions for debugging.
	•	Coding Practices:
	•	Avoid hard-coded values; use configuration files or constants.
	•	Ensure that tests are independent and can run in any order.
	•	Logging and Reporting:
	•	Integrate logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j) for better traceability.
	•	Use reporting tools to generate test execution reports.
	•	Resource Cleanup:
	•	Ensure that web drivers are properly closed after test execution.
## Test Automation Specific Guidelines

- **Element Locators:**
  - Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for WebElements.
  - Prefer using IDs or CSS selectors over XPaths for better performance.
  - Store locator values in constants or enums if they are reused.

- **Page Object Model:**
  - All element definitions and interactions should be within page classes.
  - Avoid locating elements directly in test methods.

- **Synchronization:**
  - Use explicit waits instead of `Thread.sleep()`.
  - Handle synchronization issues using `WebDriverWait` and expected conditions.

- **Exception Handling:**
  - Handle exceptions like `NoSuchElementException` appropriately.
  - Do not catch generic exceptions unless necessary.

- **Logging:**
  - Implement logging for important actions and exceptions.
  - Avoid logging sensitive information.

- **Resource Management:**
  - Ensure WebDriver instances are properly closed after test execution.
